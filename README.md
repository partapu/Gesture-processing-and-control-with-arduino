# Gesture-processing-and-control-with-arduino
I controled electrical devices connected to Ardunio by turning it on/off based on the respective gesture shown to the web camera. I used CNN algorithm to built the model to identify gestures. i used pyserial python package to integrate the system with Arduino board.
